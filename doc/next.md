# Emanote is next-gen Neuron

Neuron is now in maintenance-mode. It will receive bug fixes, but all new feature work now happen on [Emanote](https://github.com/srid/emanote).

Emanote is nearly done, and you may start using it today for your neuron notebook. However, uptree and z-index have not been implemented yet. Once that is done, Emanote will officially be publicly announced.
