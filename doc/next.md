# Emanote is next-gen Neuron

Neuron is now in **maintenance-mode**. It will continue to receive bug fixes, but all new feature work now happens on the successor project, called [Emanote](https://github.com/srid/emanote).

Emanote improves neuron in various ways. Its development is nearly done, and you may start using it today on your neuron notebook. Your notes should work for most part; see [migration notes here](https://note.ema.srid.ca/guide/neuron) on where differences lie.
